Work in progress, tested manually with python 3.7.

This installs script named "convert2ipynb.py", which converts scripts from local folder both with the code from local dependencies to single .ipynb notebook.

It is supposed to produce valid .ipynb files from the source code, which can be runnable via Kaggle Notebooks, Google Colab, etc.
